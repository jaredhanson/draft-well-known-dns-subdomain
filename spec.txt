Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 SCSS               September 2020


1.  Introduction

   Web-based protocols often require the discovery of resources or
   metadata associated with a host.  Use of Well-Known Uniform Resource
   Identifers (URIs) [RFC8615] addresses this problem by reserving a
   path prefix, "/.well-known/", which can be used by protocols that
   need to define a resource for such metadata.

   This prefix has been adopted by numerous protocols, either directly
   or indirectly through higher-level discovery protocols such as
   WebFinger [RFC7033].  For example, OpenID Connect uses well-known
   locations to discover the identity provider for a person as well as
   to discover metadata about the identity provider.

   The hosting of services that implement these protocols is often
   delegated to a third-party service provider.  For instance,
   acme.example may delegate identity services to idaas.example.
   Typically, such delegation is accompanied by a DNS CNAME record from
   id.acme.example to acme.idaas.example.

   While it is possible to delegate the service itself, discovery of
   that service using well-known URIs remains undelegated, as it occurs
   via the well-known location on the parent domain.  For instance,
   acme.example must provide a WebFinger service at
   'https://acme.example/.well-known/webfinger' to allow applications to
   discover the delegation of OpenID Connect to acme.idaas.example.

   Deployment experience suggests that the inability to delegate
   discovery in the same manner as delegating the service to be
   discovered negatively impacts the discovery of such protocols - to
   the point of discovery not being deployed and therefore unavailable
   to applications.

   To address this, this memo reserves a DNS subdomain, "well-known".
   Protocols can register their use of this subdomain in order to host
   resources or metadata needed for discovery.
